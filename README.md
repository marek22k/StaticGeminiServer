# Static gemini server

This is a simple more or less stable Gemini server, which is written in Ruby.
Feel free to report bugs as an issue.
The config.yaml is a little documented. Certificates have to be generated by yourself. Two test certificates are included.
Execute the main.rb to start the server.
