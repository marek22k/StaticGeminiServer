messages:
  # These are error messages. If a %s, there is a more detailed explanation.
  not_found: The requested resourse was not found.
  request_line_empty: "No request line was sent."
  uri_too_long: The URI is longer than the allowed 1024 characters. Therefore, the request is rejected.
  no_scheme: "No scheme was passed in the requested URI. Therefore, the request is not processed."
  wrong_scheme: "Scheme `%s` has been sent. However, this is a Gemini server which expects the scheme `gemini://`."
  timeout: "The connection was held too long, causing a timeout. The connection is terminated."
  path_injection_message: An invalid path was sent, which would have caused the server to misbehave. Therefore, the request was aborted.
  domain_not_found: "A domain was requested which was not found on the server. Therefore, the request could not be processed."
  wrong_port: "A recourse was requested on a port (%s) which does not belong to this server. The request is therefore aborted."
